# bruce-ng

bruce-ng is a collection of utility libraries and tools that I pieced together throughout the years in order to save myself a considerable amount of time from having to do repetitive tasks. Usually the effort starts with a frustration, when I'm in the middle of repeating a task for the second/third time, and I just know that I will have to repeat the task dozens more times at the very least.
