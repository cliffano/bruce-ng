# bruce-ng

bruce-ng is a collection of utility libraries and tools that I pieced together to save myself a considerable amount of time from having to do repetitive tasks. Usually it starts when I'm in the middle of repeating a task for the second/third time and I know I will have to do it dozens more times at the very least.
